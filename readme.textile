The game is simple to play.

When you run BoxGame.exe you will see the settings screen:

You can select the board size, players (2 human, human and computer or 2 computer) and whether or not making a box results in a free move.  Try playing against the "Good" computer player on a big board.  It's a pretty bad AI but it will capitalize on any mistakes and can win often enough to make it slightly less boring than watching paint dry.

The input system is pretty forgiving.  You just need to be close to the dots for the line to be snapped properly between the intended points.

The line above snapped to this:

If the matching algorithm can't find a single reasonable match it will abandon the move and you can try again.

Finally you can play a full game ...
